      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am Harini Chandrasekar, an architect passionate about crafting meaningful spaces
        through minimal and thoughtful design. My approach combines functionality with emotion, always placing user experience at the center.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey in architecture has included diverse projects—from institutional campuses to housing typologies—and I strive to blend timeless aesthetics with contextual relevance in each one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that architecture is not just about buildings, but about how people feel and interact within them. This portfolio is a reflection of that vision.
